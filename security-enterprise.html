        <h1>Enterprise-Grade Security</h1>
        
        <p>Most MCP tools today run with dangerous levels of host access. When you execute `npx` or `uvx` commands, you're essentially giving unknown code full system privileges.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            "Containerization isn't just about portability—it's about creating secure boundaries between your AI agents and your critical systems."
        </div>
        
        <p>Docker MCP changes this paradigm completely. Every MCP server runs in its own isolated container with precisely defined permissions. Your AI agents can access exactly what they need, nothing more.</p>
        
        <p>Container images can be scanned for vulnerabilities, signed for authenticity, and tracked through centralized registries. This creates an auditable supply chain that enterprise security teams can trust.</p>
        
        <p>The result? AI agents that are powerful enough to be useful, but contained enough to be safe. This is how enterprise AI should work.</p>
